                Welcome to our web site! We are the team Pen Island, we are happy that you're using
                our webpage!
                Our work has started when we have seen what is going on in the countries which are attacked by
                terrorists in
                these
                few years when terrorism have started in Europe and U.S. To be informed all the time, we are here to
                give
                you information
                from the first hand. Modern day terrorism is the most actual topic in nowdays because of public attacks
                and
                kidnapping.
                To feel our users secure, we are gathering all new articles and information from media to keep you
                informed.

                Call me Ishmael. Some years ago — never mind how long precisely — having little or no money in my
                purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the
                watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation.
                Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul;
                whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
                funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong
                moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
                people’s hats off — then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute
                for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to
                the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some
                time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
